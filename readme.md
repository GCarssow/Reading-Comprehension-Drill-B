Name:  Graham Carssow
DOB:  03/03/1982
Favorite book: Altered Carbon, by Richard K. Morgan (Netflix show coming out this Friday!)
Movie: Big Trouble in Little China
Band:  Probably Metallica
Food:  I'm basically the world's least picky eater, but if I had to pick, steak.
Past-times: Between being here and having a pregnant wife at home, I don't have time for much else.  I like snowboarding, working out, hiking with my dog (an Akita), video games, tabletop RPGs, and reading.  I'm also a big NFL fan, even though my team is heartbreak incarnate (Atlanta Falcons).  Oh yes, and coding (shameless brownie points there)!
